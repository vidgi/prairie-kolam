## prairie patterns

### crafting fabric algorithms inspired by prairie plants and traditional block-printed textiles

In this experiment, I have developed a fabric algorithm to generate patterns inspired by the traditional block-printing techniques and designs of Indian textiles. In this algorithm, the patterns and variations in parameters are fairly simplified, however it is open to placing in any image as the building block of the pattern that is repeated on borders and grids in the design. In this case, I have decided to generate prairie patterns that are based on my visual observations and sketches of various plants, as a way of showcasing prairie environments and carrying on the tradition of understanding a place through textile design.

At the moment the code/project is still a work in progress and on the simpler side, but I am happy to share the start of where I am with this!

[Read about the algorithm here](https://alpaca.pubpub.org/pub/cvr7kjj6/draft?access=sqfpq5t4) to learn more about the context which I have written up for [Algorithmic Pattern](https://algorithmicpattern.org/):

I also made a [visualization/website to showcase some of the generated patterns](https://vidyagiri.com/patchworked/) :)

### future work:

- develop more options for non-square and non-symmetric patterns with more intricacy (sari designs, other textiles)
- simulate the draping of the fabric in visualization
